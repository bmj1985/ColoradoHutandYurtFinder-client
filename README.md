## App Description

## Problem Statement
There is no central location to easily find condensed information on all of Colorado's huts and yurts.  Huts.org has a map feature with great information, but it only takes up part of the screen and is difficult to use.  This site aims to remedy these issues as well as provide some additional sorting criteria.
